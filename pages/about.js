            I&apos;m Thiago, a <em>Javascript Developer</em>, based in Sydney.
          </p>

          <p>
            I grew up in Goi√¢nia, Brazil, and moved to Sydney, Australia when I
            was 7 years old. I spent most of my life in Sydney, until my late
            20&apos;s when I moved to England for 2 years, spending most of that
            time in a town at the end of the Thames River named Leigh-on-Sea -
            where I began my journey as a software engineer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, I am still on that same learning journey, having pushed
            myself beyond Javascipt into TypeScript, as well as backend
            languages and database query syntax. I keep myself busy pushing my
            capabilities further into the space of Clean Code and Domain Driven
            Design principles and have created this blog to share my journey so
            far.
          </p>

          <p>
            Join me as descend ever deeper into the world of software
            engineering and product development!
