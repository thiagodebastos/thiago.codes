## Basics

Javascript comes packed with many built-in array manipulation methods. Two of
my favourites, particularly when used in combination with `filter()`, are the
`some()` and `every()` methods.

> The some and every methods exist on the array object, for example
> `Array.prototype.some()`.

In this article we will explore the `some()` and `every()` methods by first
writing them from scratch, and then combining them `filter()` to search for
blog posts by keywords and/or tags.

By understanding how these methods are implemented, you will gain an
appreciation for Javascript's native array methods to write cleaner, earier to
read code.

### Pre-requisites

* basic understanding of `for` loop in Javascript
* basic understanding of `Array.prototype.filter()`
* a quick skim over the concept of
  [Truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) and
  [Falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) values in
  Javascript.

### `some()`

The `some()` method takes a test function as a parameter and returns `true` if
any element in an array passed into the test function results in a *Truthy*
return value. 

> `some()` could be thought of as an `OR` operator:
> pass if a OR b OR c is true.

Before we go ahead and use the `some()` method, let's go ahead and implement it
ourselves without using any other array methods.

To implement a basic version of the `some()` method, we must write a function that:

1. takes an array and a test function as parameters
2. loop through the array
3. pass an element of the array in each loop to the test function
4. if the test function returns true, break out of the loop and return `true`
5. otherwise if no elements of the array pass the test function, return `false`

For example if we wanted to test that *any* number in an array was an even number,
we could implement it as follows:

1. Write our test function:

```js
function isEven(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0
}
```

2. Implement our own version of `some()`:
```js
function some(array, test) {
   // loop through each element of the array
   for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++) {
     // if the element passes the test function
     if(test(array[i])) {
       // exit out of the function, returning true
       return true;
     }
   }
  // if no tests above pass, then return false
  return false
}

const array1 = [1,3,6,7]
const array2 = [1,3,5,7]

some(array1, isEven) // -> true since 6 passes
some(array2, isEven) // -> false since all fail
````

And now using the native `some()` method:

```js
array1.some(isEven) // -> true since 6 passes
array2.some(isEven) // -> false since all fail
```


### `every()`

The `every()` method takes a test function as a parameter and returns `true` if
*all* elements in the array result in a *Truthy* return value from the test
function. `every()` returns `false` if *any* element of the array results in a
*Falsy* return value. 

> `every()` could be thought of as an `AND` operator:
> pass if a AND b AND c is true.

Let's start by implementing our own `every()` function from scratch, using the same
`isEven()` function we created previously:

```js
function every(array, testFn) {
  // loop through every element
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++) {
    // as soon as an element fails the test
    if (!test(array[i])) {
      // return false, breaking out of the function
      return false
    }
    // otherwise return true
    return true
  } 
}

const array1 = [2,4,6,7]
const array2 = [2,4,6,128]

every(array1, isEven) // -> false since 7 fails
every(array2, isEven) // -> true since all pass
```

Now we can implement the above using the native `every()` method:

```js
array1.every(isEven) // -> false since 7 fails
array2.every(isEven) // -> true since all pass
```


## Real world use case

 The `SearchBox` component on this website relies on several filters. One
 filter searches the blog titles for the entered searchstring, and the other
 searches blog posts for a combination of selected tags (I still have some work
 to do to search blog post content).

### Searching blog post content with string search using `some()`

One of the next features I want to implement is searching blog post content by
strings entered into the `SearchBox`.  To achieve this, we will do the
following. To check if a 'sentence' contains a 'word', we could use `some()`, but
first we would need to convert the string into an array of words, since the `some()`
method exists in Javascript's `Array` object, and not on `String`.

Let's start with something simple first - let's test if a sentence contains a word:

```js
const word = "funny"
const sentence1 = "This sentence is serious"
const sentence2 = "This sentence is funny"

// convert string into an array of strings, separated at each space
const sentence1AsArray = sentence1.split(" ")
const sentence2AsArray = sentence2.split(" ")

// check if `word` exists in each array, using `contains()`
sentence1AsArray.contains(word) // -> false
sentence2AsArray.contains(word) // -> true

```

Now let's test if a sentence contains multiple words:

```js
const words = "peas carrots"
const sentence1 = "I like carrots"
const sentence2 = "I like peas and carrots"
const sentence3 = "I like water"

// convert string into an array of strings, separated at each space
const sentence1AsArray = sentence1.split(" ")
const sentence2AsArray = sentence2.split(" ")
const sentence3AsArray = sentence3.split(" ")

// check if all words exist in a sentence
words.some(word => sentence1AsArray.contains(word)) // true
words.some(word => sentence2AsArray.contains(word)) // true
words.some(word => sentence3AsArray.contains(word)) // false

// check if all words exist in a sentence
words.every(word => sentence1AsArray.contains(word)) // false
words.every(word => sentence2AsArray.contains(word)) // true
words.every(word => sentence3AsArray.contains(word)) // false
```

### Searching by multiple tag selection using `every()`

The filter function powering the `SearchBox` component used on this blog
implements the `every()` method to filter blog posts by tag. When a user clicks
on a tag below the search box, only blog posts containing that tag are
rendered. If more than one tag is selected, then only blog posts containg
*every* tag is shown. This is testing if one array is a *subset* of another.

Below is a simplified version of what is going on, checking if an array is a
subset of another:

```js
const blogPosts = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'array methods',
    tags: ['javascript', 'arrays']
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'ASCII spaces',
    tags: ['misc']
  },
  {
    id:3,
    title: 'How to debug NodeJS in Vim',
    tags: ['javascript']
  },
]

const selectedTags = ['javascript', 'arrays']

function isSubset(array1, array2) {
  // for every element in the array
  return array2.every(
    // return true if the element exists in array1
    element => array1.includes(element)
  )
}

const filteredBlogPosts = 
  blogPosts.filter( post => isSubset(post.tags, selectedTags))
// only one post contains both selected tags:
// -> [ { id:1, title: 'array methods', tags: [ 'javascript', 'arrays' ] } ]

```

Note that the only returned blog post is post `id: 1` since that is the
only post containing both tags in `selectedTags`.

I don't know about you, but due to naming, this was a bit confusing for me at
first!

## Some gotchyas

* `every()` will return `true` if passed an empty array.
* beware of some quirks with Javascript's Truthy values, particularly empty
  arrays `[]`, empty objects `{}`, the string `"0"` and the string `"false"`.
