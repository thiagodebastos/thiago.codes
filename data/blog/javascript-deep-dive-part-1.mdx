In this series I want to explore Javascript, or rather ECMAScript, in depth.
The reason for this is that I feel I am at a point in my career where I lack
both correct terminology and succinct description for what is going on in the
software I am writing, updating or evaluating.

Ultimately, I want to improve my ability to communicate with other engineers in
the field.

### hosts and host environments

For the most part, a host is an external specification such as [WHATWG
HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/). It interfaces with the ECMAScript
specification via host layering points referred to as Annex
[D](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/host-layering-points.html#sec-host-layering-points)
in the specification. The host further definines facilities - such as abstract
operations - listed in Annex D. These network layering points can be thought of
as interfaces, or 'blueprints' for communicating with ECMAScript.

The web browser provides ECMAScript with a host environment for client-side
computation consising of objects representing various features of a web
application. Some of these objects include everything you would expect to find
in HTML, such as windows, menus, pop-ups, dialog boxes, history, cookies etc.

The host environment provides a means to connect ECMAScript code to events,
such as keypresses or form submissions.

<Callout title="Host environment" colour="info">
  A _host environment_ is a particular choice of definition for all host-defined
  facilities. A host environment typically includes objects or functions which
  allow obtaining input and providing output as host-defined properties of the
  global object.

  [tc39](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/overview.html#host-environment)
</Callout>

Similarly a web server provides a host environment for server side computation.
This includes objects representing clients, files, requests and more.

### object
A collection of zero or more _properties_, each with _attributes_ that determine how each property can be used
