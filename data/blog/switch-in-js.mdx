<Callout title="What you will learn">
  * How to use `switch` to execute conditional logic
  * The differences between `if` and `switch`
  * When to use `break` vs `return` in a `switch` statement
</Callout>

```js
const name = "fhelipe"

let isRightPerson

switch(name) {
  case "james":
    isRightPerson = false
  case "fhelipe":
    isRightPerson = true
  default:
    isRightPerson = false
}

isRightPerson // -> false
```

<Callout colour="info" title="dont forget to `break`">
  When in a switch statement, remember to `break` out of each `case` otherwise
  the code will keep evaluating through each case. Think of it as a loop that
  runs conditionally until a case fails.
</Callout>

```diff
switch(name) {
  case "james":
    isRightPerson = false
+   break
  case "fhelipe":
    isRightPerson = true
+   break
  default:
    isRightPerson = false
}

isRightPerson // -> true
```

<Callout colour="warning" title="Watch what you pass into switch">
  Remember, `switch` tests for the evaluated expression of the passed in
  parameter. If you are testing for a `boolean` value, then pass the expected
  value as the parameter. For example, if you are expecting `true` as the case,
  then pass in `true` to switch, and test that each expression tested as a
  case, evaluates to `true`.
</Callout>

```js
const score = 90

switch (score) {
  case score > 50:
    return 'great!'
  default:
    return 'better luck next time!'
} // → 'better luck next time!'
```

The code above fails - although score is greater than 50, what is actually
happening is that the case is testing that `90 === true`, which evauluates
`false`. This has tripped me up a few times in the past. The correct way
to do this is to pass `true` as a parameter to `switch`:


```js
switch (true) {
  case score > 50:
    return 'great!'
  default:
    return 'better luck next time!'
} // → 'great!'
```


```js:student-results.js
const studentResults = [
  { name: 'fhelipe', score: 99 },
  { name: 'manuel', score: 50 },
  { name: 'salatiel', score: 82 },
  { name: 'zuami', score: 73 },
  { name: 'anjela', score: 60 },
  { name: 'matteusz', score: 39 },
]
```

```js:assign-grade-to-score.js
const grades = ["fail", "pass", "credit", "distinction", "high distinction"]

function assignGradeToScore(grade, score) {
  return switch (true){
    case grade <= 49:
      return "fail"
    case grade <= 64:
      return "pass"
    case grade <= 74:
      return "credit"
    case grade <= 84:
      return "distinction"
    default:
      return "high distinction"
  }
}
```
