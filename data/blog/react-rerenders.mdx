## React anti-patterns leading to re-render issues

Assigning an object inline here will create a new object on every render

```jsx
<div style={{position: 'relative'}}>
```

#### Fix
If the style is a static object (no props), assign it to a variable outside the component

```jsx
// outside component
const styles = {{position: 'relative'}}

// inside component
<div style={styles}>
```

### Returning an assignment can lead to confusion and unintended consequences

Eslint should warn you with [no-return-assign](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-return-assign):

```jsx
<div ref={(comp) => this.formContainer = comp}>
```

#### Fix

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48413299/arrow-function-should-not-return-assignment/48413823#48413823

1. Don't return the assignment, by wrapping in parens:

```jsx
<div ref={(comp) => { this.formContainer = comp }}>
```

2. Assign to class method:

```jsx
// class method
getFormContainerRef = (comp) => this.formContainer = comp;

// inside render()
<div ref={this.getFormContainerRef}>
```
