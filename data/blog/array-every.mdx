## Basics

Javascript comes packed with many built-in array manipulation methods. Two of
my favourites, particularly when used in combination, are the `some()` and
`every()` methods.

In this articule we will explore how we can not only clean up our code by using
these built-in methods instead of loops, but also unite them to create a
combined filter function that will filter by *some* strings and *every* tag.

### Pre-requisites

* basic understanding of loops in Javascript.
* a quick skim over the concept of
  [Truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) and
  [Falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) values in
  Javascript.

### `some()`

The `some()` method takes a test function as a parameter and returns `true` if
any element in an array passed into the test function results in a *Truthy*
return value. It could be thought of as an `OR` operator: if a OR b OR c is true.

For example if we wanted to test that any number in an array was an even number,
we could implement it as follows:

```js
const array1 = [1,3,6,7]
const array2 = [2,4,6,128]

// test function
function isEven(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
}


array1.every(isEven) // -> true since 6 passes
array2.every(isEven) // -> true since all pass
```


### `every()`

The `every()` method takes a test function as a parameter and returns `true` if
*all* elements in the array result in a *Truthy* return value from the test
function. `every()` returns `false` if *any* element of the array results in a
*Falsy* return value. 

For example, if we want to test that every number in an array is an even number
we implement it like this:

```js
const array1 = [2,4,6,7]
const array2 = [2,4,6,128]

// test function
function isEven(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
}

array1.every(isEven) // -> false - fails at 7
array2.every(isEven) // -> true
```


## Real world use case

A more complex example, and something you're likely to come across out in the
wild would be in implementing search and filtering. The `SearchBox` component on
this website relies on several filters. One filter searches the blog titles for
the entered searchstring, and the other searches blog posts for a combination
of selected tags (I still have some work to do to search blog post content).

### Searching blog post content with string search using `some()`

One of the next features I want to implement is searching blog post content by
strings entered into the `SearchBox`.  To achieve this, we will do the
following:

* create a test function to check if any word exists in the blog content

```js
const searchTerm = "javascript every"

arrayOfContent = [
  {
    id: 1,
    content: "something about stuff including javascript and the term every"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    content: "abc"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    content: "javascript foo bar"
   },
  {
    id: 4,
    content: "every foo bar"
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    content: "foo bar baz"
  }
]

arrayOfContent.some(el => arrayOfContent.includes(el))
// returns content with id 1, 3, 4
```

### Searching by multiple tag selection using `every()`

The filter function powering the `SearchBox` component used on this blog
implements the `every()` method to filter blog posts by tag. When a user clicks
on a tag below the search box, only blog posts containing that tag are
rendered. If more than one tag is selected, then only blog posts containg
*every* tag is shown.

Below is a simplified version of what is going on:

```js
const blogPosts = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'array methods',
    tags: ['javascript', 'arrays']
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'ASCII spaces',
    tags: ['misc']
  },
  {
    id:3,
    title: 'How to debug NodeJS in Vim',
    tags: ['javascript']
  },
]

const selectedTags = ['javascript', 'arrays']

function checkArrayHasAllElements(array, elementsChecked) {
  // for every element in the array
  return array.every(
    // return true if the element exists in elementsChecked
    element => elementsChecked.includes(element)
  )
}

const filteredBlogPosts = 
  blogPosts.filter(
    (post) => checkArrayHasAllElements(post.tags)
  )
// only one post contains both selected tags:
// -> [ { id:1, title: 'array methods', tags: [ 'javascript', 'arrays' ] } ]

```

Note that the only returned blog post is post `id: 1` since that is the
only post containing both tags in `selectedTags`.

I don't know about you, but due to naming, this was a bit confusing for me at
first!

## Some gotchyas

* `every()` will return `true` if passed an empty array.
* beware of some quirks with Javascript's Truthy values, particularly empty
  arrays `[]`, empty objects `{}`, the string `"0"` and the string `"false"`.
